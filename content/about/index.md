Hi there! I'm Thang Pham, aka [**aome**](https://github.com/aome510). I'm a Software Engineer at [Waabi AI](https://waabi.ai) working on the onboard framework of next-generation self-driving trucks.

I enjoy building software system and tinkering with cool/new technology. My current fields of interest are robotics and autonomous systems.

During my free time, I enjoy listening to music while reading books, articles, and discussions from different websites.

{{<details summary="Fun facts">}}

- I'm an ex-Competitive Programmer. Despite not being active anymore, you can still find me on [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/AomeII), [Topcoder](https://www.topcoder.com/members/aome), and probably other online judges. In 2018, I won a gold medal representing Vietnam at [International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI)](http://stats.ioinformatics.org/people/6729).
- **AOME** is actually an acronym for [**A**pple **O**f **M**y **E**ye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_of_my_eye). I discovered the name by chance when my friend recommended me a Taiwanese film - [You Are the Apple of My Eye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Are_the_Apple_of_My_Eye).
- My go-to editor is [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs) for main work/study and [Kakoune](https://github.com/mawww/kakoune) for quick editing on the terminal. I have tried other editors such as Sublime Text, VS Code, and Vim, but Emacs (with [evil](https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil)) still fits me best because of the extensibility and its ecosystem. Checkout my [Doom Emacs configurations](https://github.com/aome510/dotfiles/tree/master/.doom.d).
- My favourite programming language is [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) ðŸ¦€. I love the safety and the high performance nature of Rust. One unique thing about Rust that I haven't found in other languages is that it just works once the code is successfully compiled.
- I enjoy watching Korean reality shows, which motivates me to learn the language (WIP). I'm also into the Korean culture, e.g, K-Pop, Korean food, etc.
