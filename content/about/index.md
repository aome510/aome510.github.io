Hi there! I'm Thang Pham, aka [**aome**](github.com/aome510). I'm currently a third-year student at University of Waterloo studying Computer Science.

My current field of interest ranges from software development to robotics, automation, and embedded programming. I love building things and experimenting with new technology.

My motto is **_never stop learning to become a better version of yourself everyday_**.

In my free time, I read tech news and blog posts on [Reddit](old.reddit.com/), [Lobster](lobste.rs/), and [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/), listen to [music](https://open.spotify.com/user/31bewedqaetpovv3yqnw44jtphsy), and read [books](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/132793035-thang-pham). I also watch Korean reality shows or read Japanese mangas for stress relief.

Other facts about me:

- I'm an ex-Competitive Programmer. You can find me on [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/AomeII), [Topcoder](https://www.topcoder.com/members/aome), and probably other online judges although I'm not active anymore. In 2018, I won a gold medal representing Vietnam at [the International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI)](http://stats.ioinformatics.org/people/6729).
- **AOME** is actually an acronym for [**A**pple **O**f **M**y **E**ye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_of_my_eye). I discovered the name by chance after my friend recommended me a Chinese film [You Are the Apple of My Eye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Are_the_Apple_of_My_Eye).
- My current editor is [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs) for main work/study and [Kakoune](https://github.com/mawww/kakoune) for quick editing on terminal. I have tried other editors such as Sublime Text, VS Code, or Vim, but Emacs (with [evil](https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil)) still fits me best because of the extensibility and its ecosystem. Check out my Doom Emacs [configurations](https://github.com/aome510/my-config-files/tree/master/.doom.d).
- My current favorite language is **Rust** 🦀. I love the safety and the high performance nature of Rust. Things just work out of the box after compilation as the Rust compiler does most of the job for you.
- My current OS is [Manjaro Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manjaro) running on a Thinkpad T495 laptop. I'm using it with [i3wm](https://i3wm.org/) as the window manager.
