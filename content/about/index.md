Hi there! I'm Thang Pham, aka [**aome**](https://github.com/aome510). I'm a third-year Computer Science student at University of Waterloo.

I enjoy building things and tinkering with cool tech. Currently, I'm interested in developing software for robotics and automation systems.

During my free time, I work on different [side projects](https://github.com/aome510) building tools for my personal uses, browse [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/), or read articles and discussions on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/), [Lobsters](https://lobste.rs/), and related websites.

Other facts about me if you're interested:

- I'm an ex-Competitive Programmer. You can find me on [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/AomeII), [Topcoder](https://www.topcoder.com/members/aome), and probably other online judges although I'm not active anymore. In 2018, I won a gold medal representing Vietnam at [the International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI)](http://stats.ioinformatics.org/people/6729).
- My motto is **_never stop learning to become a better version of yourself everyday_**.

- **AOME** is actually an acronym for [**A**pple **O**f **M**y **E**ye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_of_my_eye). I discovered the name by chance when my friend recommended me a Chinese film [You Are the Apple of My Eye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Are_the_Apple_of_My_Eye).
- My current editor is [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs) for main work/study and [Kakoune](https://github.com/mawww/kakoune) for quick editing on the terminal. I have tried other editors such as Sublime Text, VS Code, or Vim, but Emacs (with [evil](https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil)) still fits me best because of the extensibility and its ecosystem.
- My current favorite language is [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) 🦀. I love the safety and the high performance nature of Rust. Things just work out of the box after compilation as the Rust compiler does most of the job for you.
- My current OS is MacOS Big Sur running on a MacBook Air M1 (2020).
