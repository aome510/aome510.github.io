Hi there! I'm Thang Pham, aka [**aome**](https://github.com/aome510). I'm an incoming fourth-year Computer Science student at University of Waterloo.

I enjoy building things and tinkering with cool tech. Currently, I'm interested in developing software for robotics and automation systems.

During my free time, I enjoy listening to music while reading news, articles, and discussions from different websites. Beside that, I often mess around with tools/apps, customize them, and build some for my uses.

{{<details summary="Other facts">}}

- I'm an ex-Competitive Programmer. Despite not being active anymore, you can still find me on [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/AomeII), [Topcoder](https://www.topcoder.com/members/aome), and probably other online judges. In 2018, I won a gold medal representing Vietnam at [the International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI)](http://stats.ioinformatics.org/people/6729).
- **AOME** is actually an acronym for [**A**pple **O**f **M**y **E**ye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_of_my_eye). I discovered the name by chance when my friend recommended me a Chinese film [You Are the Apple of My Eye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Are_the_Apple_of_My_Eye).
- My current editor is [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs) for main work/study and [Kakoune](https://github.com/mawww/kakoune) for quick editing on the terminal. I have tried other editors such as Sublime Text, VS Code, and Vim, but Emacs (with [evil](https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil)) still fits me best because of the extensibility and its ecosystem.
- My current favourite programming language is [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) ðŸ¦€. I love the safety and the high performance nature of Rust. One unique thing Rust provides that I haven't found in other languages is that things just work once successfully compiled.
- I enjoy watching Korean reality shows, which motivates me to learn the language. I'm also into the Korean culture, e.g, K-Pop, Korean food, etc.
